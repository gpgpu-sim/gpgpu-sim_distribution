//that with different compilers a floating point number like 3.0 would get represented as either
//2.9999....or 3.00000001 and then the integer part of the floating point number (3.0) would
//be computed differently depending on the compiler. What we are doing now is to replace
//int (x) with (int) (x+EPSILON) where EPSILON is 0.5. This would fix such problems. Note that
//this works only when x is an integer >= 0.
/*
 * Sheng thinks this is more a solution to solve the simple truncate problem
 * (http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/round.html) rather than the problem mentioned above.
 * Unfortunately, this solution causes nasty bugs (different results when using O0 and O3).
 * Moreover, round is not correct in CACTI since when an extra fraction of bit/line is needed,
 * we need to provide a complete bit/line even the fraction is just 0.01.
 * So, in later version than 6.5 we use (int)ceil() to get double to int conversion.
