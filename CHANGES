CHANGE LOG:

Version 2.1.1b versus 2.1.0b:
- Added support for OpenCL (requires OpenCL driver from NVIDIA)
- Added performance visualizer tool
- Added manual documenting usage of the simulator (see doc directory)
- Added configuration file for Quadro FX5800 (see configs directory)
- Simultaneous release of benchmarks from ISPASS 2009 paper (separate download)
- Improved shared memory bank conflict modeling
- Improved default mapping of local memory accesses to global address space 
- Added interconnect concentration modeling (to approximate effect of a TPC)
- Added support for GPU-to-GPU memory copies (same GPU), timing not modeled
- SimpleScalar code (for command line parsing and functional simulation of 
  memory) removed.
- PTX support for vector operands in mov instruction
- Bug fixes
   - stack overwrite bug fix (with thanks to Jake Adriaens)
   - interconnect clock domain crossing "bottleneck" bug (was not removing
     traffic quickly enough going from memory to shader cores)
   - immediate post dominator detection (affected eigenvalues SDK benchmark)
   - CTA/core calculation error with PTX containing calls and returns
   - global symbol lookup error when building with multiple .cu files
- Other general improvements and bugfixes

Version 2.1.0b versus 2.0b:
- Added support for parsing and functionally simulating up to CUDA 2.2 
  generated PTX
- Added dynamic warp formation timing model (see MICRO'07, ACM TACO'09 papers)
- Updated gpgpusim.config and mesh in benchmark subdirectories to be similar to
  ISPASS 2009 paper baseline configurations
- Added OpenGL interoperability support
- Added support for parsing embedded PTX files without requiring recompilation 
  (suggested by Gregory Diamos)
- Improved support for texture filtering (linear mode for 2D, closer agreement
  to hardware for 2D point sampling where sample points are close to texel
  boundaries)
- Benchmark examples updated to version from CUDA 2.2 SDK (NOTE: these will not 
  compile with earlier CUDA installations. However, GPGPU-Sim should still work 
  with applications written for older versions of CUDA.)
- Fixed splash screen: was reporting incorrect version
- Fixed bug comparing strings in basic block formation code
- Fixed bug with additional basic block (which lead to incorrect postdominator 
  analysis on some benchmarks with recent versions of CUDA)
- Fixed "warning: "/*" within comment" when building.
- "Other general improvements"
