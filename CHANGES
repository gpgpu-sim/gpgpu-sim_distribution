CHANGE LOG:
Version 3.1.0 versus 3.0.2
- Support for CUDA 4.0 for both PTX and PTXPlus.
- Support for using cuobjdump to extract PTX/SASS from binaries.
- Complete rework for the SASS to PTXPlus conversion code including support for
  code generated by cuobjdump.
- Support for configurable pipeline widths.
- Support for a configurable number of functional units within an SM.
- Model for GDDR5 bank groups.
  - GDDR5 configuration.
- Extended the result bus model to allow issuing/retiring more than one
  instructions from multiple function unit per cycle.
- Support for configurable instruction latency and initiation interval
  - Added corresponding configuration to Fermi and Quadro config files according
    to benchmark results
- Support for 64-bit atomicAdd, atomicExch, and atomicCAS. 
- Support for 32-bit floating point atomicAdd. 
- New installation instructions for AerialVision, removed deprecated install
  script.
- Rework for some makefiles
- Removed the no longer supported/used decuda_to_ptxplus
- Removed all dependencies on the boost libraries. Now GPGPU-Sim can run
  without boost.
- Added missing support for -gpgpu_perfect_mem. When enabled this option models 
  a memory system with single cycle latency per memory request for accesses that 
  miss in the L1 cache. Bandwidth is limited to one memory request issued per 
  SIMT core cycle. Note this means uncoalesced accessess will be slower than 
  coalesced accesses.
- Bug Fixes:
    - Added a missed call to operand collector writeback which fixes some
      writebacks that were not considered by the operand collector.
    - Fix for a bug that caused global symbol tables to be re-initialized after
      parsing each ptx file.
    - Fix for a rare race condition that prevented kernel stats from being
      printed
    - Fix for miscalculation of the gpu_total_sim_rate value printed at the end
      of a kernel launch
    - Fix for a bug that caused atomic accesses not to have a payload to the
      Atomic Operation Unit; atomic accesses now have a payload both to and
      from the Atomic Operation Unit
    - Fixed a bug that caused deadlock check to be omitted
    - Updated the Fermi config files such that when an access misses the L1 data 
      cache, it allocates a line immediately before sending a data fetch request 
      out to the memory partition. 
    - Changed the writeback arbitration among multiple clients in the LDST unit 
      to round-robin. 
    - Fixed a rare pathological case that caused LD instructions with divergent 
      memory accesses to be overcounted.  
    - Fixed linear_to_raw_address_translation::partition_address() so that it 
      works for non-power-of-two number of memory partitions.  Before, it just 
      returns the input memory address without any change.  
    - Fixed warp_inst_t::memory_coalescing_arch_13() to use the 
      gpgpu_shmem_warp_parts option to divide up the warps in the coalescing 
      logic.  It was hardcoded to 2, which causes coalescing to always operate 
      on half-warps. 

Version 3.0.2 versus 3.0.1
- Added Fermi configuration
- Revived functional simulation mode
- AerialVision: Revived support for PC-Histogram
- AerialVision: Revived collection of source code view metrics (all except
  exposed pipeline latency)
- Added missing function implementations (caused static linking with GPGPU-Sim
  to fail).
- Fixed div_impl with 32-bit and smaller integers (Uninitialized upper bits in
  the operands was causing the instruction to behave incorrectly).
- Updated setup_environment script to handle host names with empty domains.
- Forced L2 cache line size to be greater than or equal to L1 cache line size
- L2 caches can now be disabled
- Increased Quadro config's L2 line size to 256B and total L2 size to 256kB
- Fixed generation of memory requests for local.s8 load instructions (fixed a
  bug in local memory address translation)
- Conflicting atomic accesses now generate multiple requests during coalescing
- Updated Doxygen scripts
- Fixed dump pipeline in case of L1 disabled.
- Fixed a bug in the debug printing system by making the enum and string array
  use the same list
- Fixed a bug where the ldst_unit::cycle and ldst_unit::writeback were being
  processed at different rates
- Changes to setup_environment to prevent path explosion and crashing due to
  empty host domain name
- Changed the remote OpenCL compilation to use rsync instead of scp (scp had
  issues with concurrent copying).
- Fixed the data collection code for the following metrics (in 3.0.0 and 3.0.1
  they were only counting memory instructions that generate off-core traffic):
  gpgpu_n_load_insn
  gpgpu_n_store_insn
  gpgpu_n_shmem_insn
  gpgpu_n_tex_insn
  gpgpu_n_const_mem_insn
  gpgpu_n_param_mem_insn
- Fixed a bug where the PTX load and store instructions' input address register 
  dependencies were not being registered with the scoreboard. 
- Updated how pending hits in data cache are reported (3.0.0 and 3.0.1 reports 
  the difference between the number of cache misses and pending hits). 
- Fixed a bug where a configuration with non power-of-two number of memory 
  partitions can cause two different linear address to be aliased into the 
  same intra-partition address at the same memory partition. 

Version 3.0.1 versus 3.0.0b
